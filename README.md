# Toward Organic Ambient Intelligences ? EMMA
## Abstract
 
The Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a research area investigating AI techniques to create Responsive Environments
(RE). Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) are the supports for communications between the appliances,
the deployed services and Human Computer Interface (HCI).

This thesis focuses on the design of RE with autonomic properties i.e. system that have the ability to manage
themselves. Such environments are open, large scale, dynamic and heterogeneous which induce some difficulties
in their management by monolithic system. The bio-inspired proposal considers all devices like independent
cells forming an intelligent distributed organism. Each cell is programmed by a DNA-RNA process composed of
reactive rules describing its internal and external behaviour. These rules are modelled by reactive agents with
self-rewriting features offering dynamic reprogramming abilities.

The EMMA framework is composed of a modular Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) Middleware based
on IPv6 LoW Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) technology and a MAPE-K architecture to design
multi-scale AmI. The different relations between technical issues and theoretical requirements are discussed
through the platforms, the network, the middleware, the mobile agents, the application deployment to the
intelligent system. Two algorithms for AmI are proposed: an Artificial Neural Controller (ANC) model for
automatic control of appliances with learning processes and a distributed Voting Procedures (VP) to synchronize
the decisions of several system components over the WSAN.
